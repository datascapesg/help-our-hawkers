        "details": "Sim Ah Tee, 73, is a hawker for over 50 years Being unable to read or write, Ah Tee was at a disadvantage when the Covid-19 Circuit Breaker started last year. While eateries and hawkers scrambled to offer food delivery, Ah Tee could not keep up with the new technology. “At the age of 70 plus, he’s not agile enough to multitask anymore. He’s still using the old Nokia handphone,” his son Calvin Sim, 49, tells 8days.sg. It doesn’t help that Ah Tee (pictured above) also faces competition from the bigger, more well-known Berseh Food Centre nearby. Despite the slow business, he has continued to open his stall as usual. “He’s a committed person. He’s making a loss every day, but insisted on carrying on till now despite using his own savings [to sustain]. As I’m working, I can’t manage his calls for him,” says Calvin, who tried to help his dad drum up business by posting about the stall on Facebook foodie groups like Can Eat! Hawker Food.",

Together with his partner Anne Tan, 59, he runs the 85 乡村古早蚝煎 stall at Fengshan Centre in Bedok selling fried oyster omelette, carrot cake, bak chor mee and handmade ngoh hiang till 11pm daily.  From February to June last year, they had zero income as their hawker centre was undergoing renovations, which were delayed by the pandemic. When Phase 2 (HA) kicked in on May 14, 2021, there was immediately a “drastic drop” in business. Speaking to 8days.sg, Peng Huan’s daughter Desrina Goh, 39, says: “There was a 60 per cent drop in customers. Today was the worst yet, not even 30 per cent of the usual number of customers.” Delivery is also out of the question for Peng Huan. “My dad is illiterate, so it’s very difficult for him to work with a digital delivery platform. WhatsApp orders are not possible as well, because he can’t read,” Desrina frets.",

This unassuming couple are up 3am every day, preparing fresh Yong Tau Foo for sale. They serve yummy versions such as the Dry (sweet sauce), Soupy and Laksa. Look at the variety and you know it is a hit with the elderly – who loves items such as brinjal, lady-finger, yam, pork belly, intestines and so forth. Their Laksa is very very old-school-authentic, too! Serene insisted to serve value for money Yong Tau Foo in the Macpherson community for the past 7 years. She refused to raise price even as supplies do get more expensive over the years. Always courteous, Steven serves his wok-hei Char Kway Teow at the back of the stall as supplement as the elderly loves it. The one and only Yong Tau Foo stall in this market. Pls support if you are in the area! P/S: Serene’s parents used to own this famous Yong Tau Foo stall in Kallang Airport for the past 30 years – 40 years and they decided to retire and pass down the family recipe!",

I took a quick glance and two items immediately caught my eye - 卤猪脚Braised Pig Trotters and 麻油鸡 Sesame Oil Chicken.  Uncle happily obliged my sinful request for fattier parts of the pig trotters and also gave me a good-sized serving of chicken. Auntie tempted me with a spoonful of her special 家乡猪肚汤 Pig Stomach Soup which was peppery, the way I like it. I will definitely return to try that and also the 肉骨茶 Bak Kut Teh / Pork Rib Soup & 干炒老鼠粉Stir Fried Mee Tai Mak �� As I was leaving, the couple expressed their heartfelt gratitude for my patronage.

I added 2 more soon kueh and she didn't charge extra for separating the sauce.  How much profit can she be making? If she goes to delivery platforms, how much do we have (r we willing)to pay for 2 ccf+2sk? These are the people I hope to help,  and if you are nearby, do give them your support.

This stall was originally located at Taman Jurong (next to the Indian cinema). Due to redevelopment in the area, the stall owners had to relocate to a few other places and eventually settled for the current location. The old place was popular with many Malaysian workers during that period.   They used to sell a large variety of noodles like Curry Chicken Noodles, Shredded Chicken Noodles and Soy Sauce Chicken. However, due to their old age they could no longer afford to offer so many dishes. Fortunately, they have kept their signature Wanton Noodles, and have added popular noodle choices of Minced Pork Noodles and Laksa to their menu for the younger generation. These 3 noodles have also become their best seller at their current location.  Stall owner are still working till date because they need to earn a living for their daily expenses.   So, please do help them out when you are around the area!",

Found this old school porridge & fried beehoon stall, only 3 items on offer: beehoon, mee and porridge. Tapao porridge and beehoon, at $1.20 each, plus $0.20 for container.  Verdict: Wow! Flavourful beehoon, simply fried with bean sprout. Old school flavour, not mushy. We found the sambal chili was an unnecessary distraction. Could have done without it. Porridge was simple plain one with soft peanuts. Loaded with umami from 柴鱼! We love the smooth texture. Both times were really well made. Surprise find. Must eat!",

You can pack soup away for extra cost of 30cts for takeaways but before covid is free to take and is kinda of soup ur mom will make comprise of chicken feet’s and stuff.  Stall has no delivery mode and they opened early from 9am onwards till finished every day.  Do visit them when you are in boon Keng  I been eating them consecutively for more than 10 times and meat is consistent. They don’t have delivery mode and pay them a visit instead on the spot to support them. I will said this is a hidden gem while they have their own fan base as well.",

        "details": "A gem hidden in a less popular neighbourhood of Singapore, Geylang East Food Centre. I chanced upon it last Wednesday when I was there dabao-ing for the family.  Saw an old uncle (stall owner) sitting in his stall waiting for customers. Obviously, his stall didn’t catch the attention of many patrons. But I decided to jump in to try. Weather was afterall hot and I don’t have much appetite to eat something that it’s too heavy. Looking at the long list in the menu, I ordered a prawn cheong fan @ $2.50 with 6 prawns in it and a bowl of cuttlefish and pork porridge for $2.50. I watched every skilful step he took to make that one roll of cheong fan for me. From laying the flour mixture and steaming it to adding the ingredients, all made with love. Items are mostly priced $2.50/$3.  Was surprised how soft the chee cheong fan was (just like those that I tried at Chinese restaurants) and it went perfectly well with the savoury hk style black sauce. Congee was smooth with abundant slices of pork and cuttlefish.  I know I will go back to that stall again. And here I am, at Geylang East Food Centre (Stall # 01-26) to dabao lunch for the family. This time round I remembered to whip out my camera to take some insta-worthy photos and share it with you all.  Enjoy all!",

Have been buying from this shui kueh uncle for more than 20 years.  He used to be very chatty and loved to joke when his partner was around.  Haven't seen the elderly lady for some years and uncle seems to be more quiet.   Missed the time when he jokingly teased me on my 书包 (a backpack I used to carry).  What I really love about his stall, 1) he makes the shui kueh himself,  2) he is still steaming the kueh in old school metal container,  not disposable plastic. Usually,  there is a reasonable Q to keep him busy.  Recent weeks, noticed that he is less busy.  Maybe shui kueh is not a main course... sadden to see him sitting quietly by his stall.  Whenever I see that, just want to keep him busy, to motivate him.  When patronizing the hawker center,  hope you can get some snacks from him.  ",

In fact, I passed by them few times and realised they barely have any customers. They sell bee Hoon and mutton soup. They are not on delivery platforms nor using any electronic payment methods. Taste wise, it’s just like any home cooked meal. A bit salty but that’s nothing compared to their hard work and enduring the wait to have someone come by to buy from them. If by bearing with the saltiness can trade happiness for them, I am more than willing to do so. If you come this hawker, try to support them.",

        "details": "I decided to venture into Jln Batu Hawker Centre. As I was walking around, I noticed this lone figure sitting quietly staring at his mobile phone inside his stall. In my 5 minutes of observation, I noticed maybe 15 folks walked past his stall. Not a single one of them approach his stall. I decided to walk up to his stall.  When Uncle saw me approaching him, he eagerly stand up and asked what I would like to have. I can sense his urgency but when he said, I am his 1st customer of the day. My heart sank deeply at that moment.  The time then was 1145am, politely I asked if his sales takings were affected by the recent prohibition of dining in. He gave out a loud sigh.. I can sense his helplessness then and there. Jokingly he said \"人算不如天算\" (unpredictable situation). \"Its a very tough situation\". He relies on regulars and walk in customers. Now that it is the by default mode to WFH, his regulars don't come that frequently anymore. And walk in customers who can't dine in, are not buying drinks from him that much. Also, Jln Batu Hawker Centre can be a bit ulu to some.  Regardless of the situation, Uncle still maintain his positive outlook. With a sense of pride, he strongly recommended to me his 100% handmade agar agar jelly dessert. He said his agar agar is probably the cheapest or if not, one of the cheapest that one can ever locate in Singapore. At 0.50cents a piece of the agar agar jelly, they come in various flavours. Coffee, Yam, Rainbow, plain and few others - really Can Eat for me. This is the best part - Uncle refused to increase his price over the years. He said his customers included mostly senior citizens and those who are staying around the area are in 1, 2 and 3 rooms flat. Affordability is an issue to some of the folks there. Uncle said he could not bear to increase his pricing and would rather earn lesser or none at times. Even when he is struggling to stay afloat, he still has a compassion heart for others. For this, he has my utmost respect. What surprises me was that Uncle is also selling his agar agar jelly in a big square plastic container box at only $4 - see picture. I got 3 boxes of Yam agar agar jelly without hesitation. Uncle was very appreciative and hope that I will come back soon to try his yakult fruit juices. He is also selling slice cut fruits too.  Folks, this is one genuine Hawker whose business is greatly affected by the present situation. He has a big heart and filled with compassion. He deserve all your support, so please go down to support him and share this post for greater awareness. Whether its a slice of cut fruit or a piece of agar agar jelly at 0.50 cents or a cup of fruit juice, it matters alot to him.",

I was walking around and observing that many stalks are doing brisk business (probably due to a wet and rainy Saturday) until I spotted this lone stall - there was no one in queue. I observed that maybe one or 2 folks would walk up to the stall, take a look and walk off. I do not know why.  I decided to go up to the Aunty and strike up a conversation with her. Aunty is very soft spoken. She manage this stall on her own most times and sometimes with ad hoc help. She gets up early to prepare the ingredients. She / her stall is not on any delivery platform / FB.  She told me her business is so bad that she hardly makes any money. If not for the one month rental rebate from G, she hardly makes any money after deducting all the ingredients and supplies etc.  Her fear is understandable. So much so that she does not even dare to make more than 10 Vadai at a time for fear of them becoming too cold and hard which she is worried that it will make her lose her usual and maybe potential customers.  I bought a few Vadai back to try and I must say at $0.60cents a piece, they are good. Soft and flavourful. I choose to support her which I really think she genuinely needed more support in letting people know her existence.  As you are reading this, this is one such stall that you can seriously consider showing your support to her and by sharing this post. Not very expensive / difficult to begin with.  What is genuinely needed here is more support, more sharing and awareness for her. Life is already very tough for her at the current situation and its getting more harder each day as she wonders how long she can keep going and sustain it.",

        "details": "Was in the area today and visited Albert Food Centre this afternoon. Bought indian rojak from the popular Siraj Indian Rojak, whom I used to patronise some 15 years ago every Sunday. Uncle had a brief chat with me, saying that business has really been bad especially on Sundays when it’s usually the most busy for him. Some stalls along his row have closed on Sundays, as they’ve given up. Could sense his frustrations, and he also casually asked how I know about his store. He’s heard about hawkers being shared on social media etc, but doesn’t seem to have a clue on how that works. So just helping him out and posting a shout out here, especially since his Indian Rojak is nice. So do give it a try if you’re in Bugis area!!",

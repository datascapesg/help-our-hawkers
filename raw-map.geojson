While eateries and hawkers scrambled to offer food delivery, Ah Tee could not keep up with the new technology. “At the age of 70 plus, he’s not agile enough to multitask anymore. He’s still using the old Nokia handphone,” his son Calvin Sim, 49, tells 8days.sg. It doesn’t help that Ah Tee (pictured above) also faces competition from the bigger, more well-known Berseh Food Centre nearby. Despite the slow business, he has continued to open his stall as usual. “He’s a committed person. He’s making a loss every day, but insisted on carrying on till now despite using his own savings [to sustain]. As I’m working, I can’t manage his calls for him,” says Calvin, who tried to help his dad drum up business by posting about the stall on Facebook foodie groups like Can Eat!

Together with his partner Anne Tan, 59, he runs the 85 乡村古早蚝煎 stall at Fengshan Centre in Bedok selling fried oyster omelette, carrot cake, bak chor mee and handmade ngoh hiang till 11pm daily.  From February to June last year, they had zero income as their hawker centre was undergoing renovations, which were delayed by the pandemic. When Phase 2 (HA) kicked in on May 14, 2021, there was immediately a “drastic drop” in business. Speaking to 8days.sg, Peng Huan’s daughter Desrina Goh, 39, says: “There was a 60 per cent drop in customers. Today was the worst yet, not even 30 per cent of the usual number of customers.” Delivery is also out of the question for Peng Huan. “My dad is illiterate, so it’s very difficult for him to work with a digital delivery platform. WhatsApp orders are not possible as well, because he can’t read,” Desrina frets.<br><br>Contributor:<br>8 Days<br><br>Take a photo when you visit this stall and share your support!:<br>Facebook: https://j.mp/3pN65kL<br>Twitter: https://j.mp/3gevG38"

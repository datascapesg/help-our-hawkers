His stall doesn't look super attractive initially but I reassure you, it's delicious. The horfun, beehoon, mee goreng, fried veg w rice all has plenty of wokhey and is very very very affordable for Holland V (price ranges from $3-5). Pls help him out because I really think his food deserve a chance to continue to impress everyone like myself :-)",

As I was walking around, I noticed this lone figure sitting quietly staring at his mobile phone inside his stall. In my 5 minutes of observation, I noticed maybe 15 folks walked past his stall. Not a single one of them approach his stall. I decided to walk up to his stall.  When Uncle saw me approaching him, he eagerly stand up and asked what I would like to have. I can sense his urgency but when he said, I am his 1st customer of the day. My heart sank deeply at that moment.  The time then was 1145am, politely I asked if his sales takings were affected by the recent prohibition of dining in. He gave out a loud sigh.. I can sense his helplessness then and there. Jokingly he said \"人算不如天算\" (unpredictable situation). \"Its a very tough situation\". He relies on regulars and walk in customers. Now that it is the by default mode to WFH, his regulars don't come that frequently anymore. And walk in customers who can't dine in, are not buying drinks from him that much. Also, Jln Batu Hawker Centre can be a bit ulu to some.  Regardless of the situation, Uncle still maintain his positive outlook. With a sense of pride, he strongly recommended to me his 100% handmade agar agar jelly dessert. He said his agar agar is probably the cheapest or if not, one of the cheapest that one can ever locate in Singapore. At 0.50cents a piece of the agar agar jelly, they come in various flavours. Coffee, Yam, Rainbow, plain and few others - really Can Eat for me. This is the best part - Uncle refused to increase his price over the years. He said his customers included mostly senior citizens and those who are staying around the area are in 1, 2 and 3 rooms flat. Affordability is an issue to some of the folks there. Uncle said he could not bear to increase his pricing and would rather earn lesser or none at times. Even when he is struggling to stay afloat, he still has a compassion heart for others. For this, he has my utmost respect. What surprises me was that Uncle is also selling his agar agar jelly in a big square plastic container box at only $4 - see picture. I got 3 boxes of Yam agar agar jelly without hesitation. Uncle was very appreciative and hope that I will come back soon to try his yakult fruit juices. He is also selling slice cut fruits too.  Folks, this is one genuine Hawker whose business is greatly affected by the present situation. He has a big heart and filled with compassion. He deserve all your support, so please go down to support him and share this post for greater awareness. Whether its a slice of cut fruit or a piece of agar agar jelly at 0.50 cents or a cup of fruit juice, it matters alot to him.<br><br>Contributor:<br>Louis Tan",

I got 3 boxes of Yam agar agar jelly without hesitation. Uncle was very appreciative and hope that I will come back soon to try his yakult fruit juices. He is also selling slice cut fruits too.  Folks, this is one genuine Hawker whose business is greatly affected by the present situation. He has a big heart and filled with compassion. He deserve all your support, so please go down to support him and share this post for greater awareness. Whether its a slice of cut fruit or a piece of agar agar jelly at 0.50 cents or a cup of fruit juice, it matters alot to him.",
